" If you would like to disable an included plug-in, you can do that with the janus#disable_plugin()
" function from inside your ~/.vimrc.before. This function takes a plug-in name as an argument
" without the group. For example, if you would like to disable the NERDCommenter plug-in, you can do
" that with the command:
"
" $ echo "call janus#disable_plugin('nerdcommenter')" >> ~/.vimrc.before
